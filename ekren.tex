\chapter{Ekren}

Our \he2 Opener shows a weak hand with both majors.  We have agreed that it can be as short as 4--4 NV vs Vul only, otherwise the expected length is 5--4 either direction. Expected HCP should be approximately the same as our weak 2 bids, 3--9.  The only asking bid is 2NT.  I don't believe we have ever spelled out the responses, so I'm taking a stab here.  I am also uncertain if 3 of a minor is forcing or NF.

\begin{bidtable}{2h}
	\sp2 & NF \\
	2NT & Asking \\
	\cl3/\ddd & Nat and \ldots ? \\
	\he3/\sss & Mixed \\
	\cl4 & Preemptive, asks for transfer to longer or \sss ~if equal \\
	\di4 & Preemptive, asks for bid to longer, Opener may choose when equal \\	
\end{bidtable}

\begin{bidtable}{2h,2n}
	\cl3 & All non-minimum. \\
	\di3 & Min with longer \hhh \\
	\he3 & Min with equal or longer \sss \\
\end{bidtable}

Over the non-min response, \di3 asks with criss-cross responses:
\begin{bidtable}{2h,2n,3c,3d}
	\he3 & Longer \sss \\
	\sp3 & Longer \hhh \\
	3NT & (NV) 4--4 \\
	3NT & (Vul) 5--5 Medium \\
	\cl4/\ddd & 5--5 and shortness, Vul this is stronger than 3NT \\	
\end{bidtable}

In 2NT -- Resp auctions, \cl4 by Responder is Hexa Preempt RKC if no trump suit is established or normal Preempt RKC if there is a trump suit.
