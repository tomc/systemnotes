\chapter{Ekren}

Our \he2 Opener shows a very weak hand with both majors.  The expected length is at least 5--4 in either direction, but a \third seat WR on 4--4 wouldn't shock anyone. Expected HCP is weaker than our Weak 2s, approximately 1 to a bad 9. (Singleton Q, etc.)  The only asking bid is 2NT.  This is a best effort by Tom to put together a simple structure, but it has been agreed as of PHX.

\begin{bidtable}{2h}
	\sp2 & NF \\
	2NT & Asking \\
	\cl3/\ddd & Nat and forcing\\
	\he3/\sss & Wide ranging preempt \\
	\cl4 & Preemptive, asks for transfer to longer or \sss ~if equal \\
	\di4 & Preemptive, asks for bid to longer, Opener may choose when equal \\	
\end{bidtable}

\begin{bidtable}{2h,2n}
	\cl3 & All non-minimum. \\
	\di3 & Min with longer \hhh \\
	\he3 & Min with equal or longer \sss \\
\end{bidtable}

Over the non-min response, \di3 asks with criss-cross responses:
\begin{bidtable}{2h,2n,3c,3d}
	\he3 & Longer \sss \\
	\sp3 & Longer \hhh \\
	3NT & 5--5 Medium \\
	\cl4/\ddd & 5--5 and shortness, maximum \\	
\end{bidtable}

In 2NT -- Resp auctions, \cl4 by Responder is Hexa Preempt RKC if no trump suit is established or normal Preempt RKC if there is a trump suit.
