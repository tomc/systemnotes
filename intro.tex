\chapter{Introduction by Tom}

Since I needed to rebuild the document structure anyway, I'm taking this opportunity to merge the document flow for the Jenni, Ari and Christian partnerships into a single new grand unification of the notes.  

The main meat of the document will be maintained to be compatible with all partnerships, the document will be compiled with the appropriate name-tom.tex file to generate that PDF.  The notes will be interspersed with \textit{if} statements to ensure the accuracy for the individual partnership while allowing the common elements to only need a single point of editing to ensure consistency across.

\section{Versions}

\subsection{Initial Version - Nov 2022}

Canonical version, will include any changes from previous March 2022 version of tom-jenni.  Ari version hasn't been touched in a bit so I will try to pull in the notes ``as is''.

\section{Notation}

Notation hasn't changed from previous versions, with one new addition:  just as we use "5+ \textit{suit}" to indicate 5 or more cards in a suit, I'm introducing "5= \textit{suit}" to mean exactly 5 cards, no more no less.  Similarly "5- \textit{suit}" means 5 or fewer cards.

% previous version used a description environment instead
