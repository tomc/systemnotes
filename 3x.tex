	Aggressive, does not promise any quality. 
	
	I have a joke about my preempts: I strictly follow the rule of 500, so long as the opponents promise not to double.
	
	White/Red there probably isn't a hand which contains a 7 card suit that Tom would pass.
	
	New suits are forcing, \cl4 is Preempt RKC (or \di4 over \cl3). 0, 1 w/o Q, 1 w/ Q, 2.
