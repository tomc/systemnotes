		\sp3 & Puppet to 3NT for minor suit hands. \\
		3NT & To play \\
		\cl4 & 1430 Gerber \\
		\di4 & Xfer \\
		\he4 & Xfer \\

\section{Stayman Agreements}

\rem{T}{This is optional but Tom's preference. It's mostly ignorable. See \sp3 and 3NT responses as well as \he3 extensions.}

	\begin{bidtable}{2n,3c}
		\di3 & No 4 card major. 3M rebid over this is Smolen. 4m is natural and forcing. There are no delayed Texas type sequences directly, go through Smolen. \\
		\he3 & 4+ \hhh. \sp3 asks about heart length and/or is a \hhh~ slam try. Opener bids 3NT with only 4, (over which a new suit is a cuebid slam try for \hhh) or bids \he4 or cuebids a minor with 5 \hhh. Responder doesn't promise a slam try, they can simply be trying to confirm a 5 card suit. \\
		\sp3 & 4= \sss. \he4 agrees \sss~ with slam interest, \cl4/\ddd~ are natural (not cuebids). \\
		3NT & 5= \sss. \he4\rightarrow\sp4 (with or without slam interest), \cl4/\ddd~ are natural. \\
	\end{bidtable}

\section{Transfer Agreements}

\he3 then \he4 shows \exactshape{55xx} or better without slam interest.
\di3 then \sp3 shows \exactshape{55xx} or better with slam interest.

4m rebids are natural and forcing.

Jacoby then 4NT:  Quant
Texas than 4NT:  RKC (1430)
Texas than new suit: Exclusion (0314)

\section[3S]{\sp3}

Puppet to 3NT for minor suit hands.

\begin{bidtable}{2n,3s,3n}
	\cl4 & \ddd Optional KC \\
	\di4 & \ccc. Optional KC \\
	4M & Shortness in bid M, \exactshape{xx55} or better with slam interest. \\
	4NT & \exactshape{xx55} or better with no slam interest. \\
\end{bidtable}

If Opener bids a ``don't like'' step, +1 is ``don't care, RKC.'' 4NT by Responder is NF.
